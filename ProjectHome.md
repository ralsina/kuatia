Kuatia: "paper" in guaran√≠

A WYSIWYM editor widget.

The idea is use semantic markup **only** on a paragraph level, not allow for anything else.

In general, try to follow the concepts of reStructured Text, and in fact, use it to export the documents to PDF or HTML.

A first approach was done in this video:

Of course this is a long term project, but the final goal is a simple, pleasant word processing widget that can be used for creative writing (for example in Marave: http://marave.googlecode.com)
